# Title
FLOWSA: A python package attributing resource use, waste, emissions, and other flows to industries

# Abstract
FLOWSA is a python package that attibutes resource use, waste, emissions, loss and other movements of mass, energy, monetary or human resources -- collectively called flows -- to industries. Models can be developed to capture flows to and from the environment and industries, as well as transfers between industry sectors. Data on flow generation and use by activity are pulled transparently from providers and standarized but otherwise numerically unchanged in preparation for modeling. Multiple datasets are often to drive an industry attribution model along with crosswalks to relate reported activities to sectors. FLOWSA can development of models of totals by sector using these data inputs and user specified rules to produce various totals by sector outputs that can be used for comparision of methodological, geographical, and temporal variation sector attribution.
The standard data outputs from these models have been used as environmental data inputs into the latest version of the USEEIO model, a life cycle model of US goods and services in ~400 categories. This communication demonstrates FLOWSA's capability by describing models for US industry use of water, land, and employment with varying methodologies. FLOWSA is publicly available on GitHub and many of the data outputs are available on the EPA Data Commons.
