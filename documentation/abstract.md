# Title
FLOWSA: A python package attributing resource use, waste, emissions, and other flows to industries

# Abstract
FLOWSA is a python package that attibutes resource use, waste, emissions, loss and other movements of mass, energy, monetary or human resources -- collectively called flows -- to industries. Models can be developed to capture flows to and from the environment and industries, as well as transfers between industry sectors. 
FLOWSA allows for the flexible development of models of totals by sector, enabling comparision of methodological, geographical, and temporal variation on NAICS sector attribution.
We have implemented  models for generating US water use by industry, US state water use by industry, US land use by industry, US criteria pollutant emissions by industry, and 
.  The standard data outputs from these models have been used as environmental data inputs into the latest version of the USEEIO model, a life cycle model of US goods and services in ~400 categories. 
This communication demonstrates FLOWSA's capability by describing models for water, land, and employment with varying methodologies. FLOWSA is publicly available on GitHub.
