# Abstract
<!-- A concise and factual abstract is required, with a restriction of 150 words. The abstract should -->
<!-- state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract -->
<!-- is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, -->
<!-- References should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). Also, non-standard -->
<!-- or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first -->
<!-- mention in the abstract itself. -->

# Graphical abstract
<!-- A Graphical abstract is optional and should summarize the contents of the article in a concise, pictorial -->
<!-- form designed to capture the attention of a wide readership online. Authors must provide images -->
<!-- that clearly represent the work described in the article. Graphical abstracts should be submitted as a -->
<!-- separate file in the online submission system. Image size: Please provide an image with a minimum -->
<!-- of 531 × 1328 pixels (h × w) or proportionally more. The image should be readable at a size of 5 × -->
<!-- 13 cm using a regular screen resolution of 96 dpi. Preferred file types: TIFF, EPS, PDF or MS Office -->
<!-- files. See http://www.elsevier.com/graphicalabstracts for examples. -->
<!-- Authors can make use of Elsevier's Illustration and Enhancement service to ensure the best -->
<!-- presentation of their images also in accordance with all technical requirements: Illustration Service. -->

# Highlights
<!-- Highlights are mandatory for this journal. They consist of a short collection of bullet points that convey -->
<!-- the core findings of the article and should be submitted in a separate file in the online submission -->
<!-- system. Please use 'Highlights' in the file name and include 3 to 5 bullet points (maximum 85 -->
<!-- characters, including spaces, per bullet point). See http://www.elsevier.com/highlights for examples. -->
<!-- AUTHOR INFORMATION PACK 9 Aug 2016 www.elsevier.com/locate/envsoft 10 -->

# Keywords
<!-- Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords, using American spelling and -->
<!-- avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of'). Be sparing -->
<!-- with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords -->
<!-- will be used for indexing purposes. -->

# Software and/or data availability section
<!-- Where appropriate, a software/data availability section should be provided, containing as much of -->
<!-- the following information as possible: name of software or data set, developer and contact address, -->
<!-- telephone, fax and e-mail numbers, year first available, hardware required, software required, -->
<!-- availability and cost. Also for software: program language, program size; for data: form of repository -->
<!-- (data base, files, spreadsheet), size of archive, access form. -->
<!-- When a software component is an essential part of the paper presentation, authors should be prepared -->
<!-- to make it available to reviewers during the review process. To preserve the anonymity of reviewers, -->
<!-- the authors should make the software available for a download, protecting it if needed by a password -->
<!-- that is communicated to the editors. -->

# Introduction
<!-- State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature -->
<!-- survey or a summary of the results. -->

# Material and methods
<!-- Provide sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced. Methods already published should be -->
<!-- indicated by a reference: only relevant modifications should be described. -->

# Results
<!-- Results should be clear and concise. -->

# Discussion
<!-- This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. A combined Results -->
<!-- and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published -->
<!-- literature. -->

# Conclusions
<!-- The main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short Conclusions section, which may stand -->
<!-- alone or form a subsection of a Discussion or Results and Discussion section. -->

# Appendices
<!-- If there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as A, B, etc. Formulae and equations in -->
<!-- appendices should be given separate numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.; in a subsequent appendix, -->
<!-- Eq. (B.1) and so on. Similarly for tables and figures: Table A.1; Fig. A.1, etc. -->

# Abbreviations
<!-- Define abbreviations that are not standard in this field in a footnote to be placed on the first page -->
<!-- of the article. Such abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined at their first -->
<!-- mention there, as well as in the footnote. Ensure consistency of abbreviations throughout the article. -->

|Acronym |Definition |
|---|---|
|BEA |Bureau of Economic Analysis |
|IO |Input-Output |
|EEIO |Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Model |
|MRIO | Multi-Regional Input-Output model | 
|USEEIO |US EPA's United States Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Model |
|SEF |EEIO-based supply chain emission factor|

# Acknowledgements
<!-- Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do -->
<!-- not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those -->
<!-- individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance -->
<!-- or proof reading the article, etc.).We encourage the inclusion of a brief outline of the contributions of -->
<!-- authors in this section, for example: "Author contributions: T.L., E.K. and H.S. designed the research; -->
<!-- T.L., E.K., W.L. and H.S. performed the research; T.L. and E.K. analysed the data; and T.L., W.L. -->
<!-- and H.S. wrote the paper." Other contribution categories may include model coding, programming -->
<!-- support, research conception, etc. -->
