Big picture of EPA's LCA tool ecosystem. Walkthrough of EPA efforts on environmental flows sector attribution. Mo to present on useeior and how environmental flows out of FLOWSA are used. 

# Outline
## Big Picture
1. useeior overview
2. flowsa overview
3. LCA Tool Ecoysystem graphics

## FLOWSA
### walk through creating water FBS
1. Water methodology graphics, m1 and m2
2. The graphics are translated in python as an FBS method yaml 
3. FBS yamls easily modified
4. FBA format - original data, reformatted
5. Crosswalks source activities to NAICS - similar to USDA's MITERS
6. Example CSVS for FBA and FBS

## Use of FLOWSA Outputs
1. flowsa environmental data feeds into useeior - which Mo will describe later
2. Show output data for water used in ACLCA pres

## USEEIOR
1. Mo to discuss...
