# Terms

**flows**: represent the physical movement of material or energy as input or output to or between activities. 

**sectors**: generally these are economic sectors generating economic activity, but are extended here to include households and institutional end users. Using the BEA definitions in input-output tables, these can be either industries or commodities.

***sector attribution**: Assigning flows to sectors through which activity uses, produces or receives the flows (input or output).*

::: notes
In LCA terms these are more strictly elementary flows or waste flows, although these LCA uses will not limit the scope of FLOWSA models.
